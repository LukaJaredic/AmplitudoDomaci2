Code displays a table of movies, allowing insertion of movie if fields Name,Year and Actors are valid.
Code also allows the user to set movie as watched/not watched which changes its background to green/red.
Code doesnt save any data, it is meant only as frontend practice of processing user input and manipulating HTML and CSS with javascript.
Styling are mostly done with the help of Bootstrap 5.
